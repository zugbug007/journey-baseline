Start to think about what wuld be required on day one, day 14 and day 30 that can be done now.

Build mock up deck based on what is currently working to shape what is needed next

How to automate needed graphs for the decks - journey, metrics and graphs
Reports with other metrics not Visits - e.g. success events
Add Scatter plots and hull plot overlay to get the journey groupings

Compare biggest change against previous day
Show best worst other graphs - not just top/bot 10 graph
E.g. how to identify the best /worst performing in each journey 
Add legend for dumb bell plots

Lower Priority

Original - The full, normal data for the metric.
Seasonal - Identifies seasonal patterns present in the series.
Spike - Identifies larger-than-expected temporary changes.
Trend - Highlights the underlying level of the series, and changes in level.
Error - Random noise not explained by other components of the series.

Click on the series legend items below to see how each component explains part of the series. Hover over the Original series to see the lower/upper bounds for the metric, as well as the expected value and any anomalies.
Trend & Seasonality uses Adobe Sensei to help you better understand the makeup of a specific metric over time by decomposing the data into different categories - spikes, trends, seasonality, and model error. Drag-and-drop any metric of your choosing, and select a desired confidence level for determining significance of anomalies. Granularity of the trend will be determined by the length of the panel date range.

Daily Journey movement
Predictions for each journey - https://rpubs.com/heruwiryanto/Causal_impact
Last x days comparison of post vs post - (x days)
Then slope graph to show the changes of all journeys or dumbbell plot 
Check % graphs are correctly shwoing %
Add column name for dates rather than 3-dA
